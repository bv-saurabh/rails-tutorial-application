This project implements the sample blog application from the official ruby on rails tutorial
available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

This project implement a very simple blog application with only two controllers, articles and comments.

The user can see a list of all the articles, display a specific article, create new articles, edit
the existing articles or delete them.

Users can also comment on the articles. This is accomplished by the comments controllers. It also
provides all the CRUD operations on comments.

This basic application covers all the basic concepts of Ruby on Rails.
